ThotBot3000 — Discord E-Girl Bot (Offline & Free)
Flirty. Fun. Forever free. Built on Replit, evolving in Visual Studio Pro.

🧠 Project Overview
ThotBot3000 is a cheeky, AI-simulated Discord e-girl chatbot named Cherry 🍒, built from scratch using Python. She flirts, compliments, tracks simps, and brings spicy energy to your server — without using paid AI like GPT. Everything is handcrafted and hosted 100% free on Replit, with the full plan to migrate and evolve the bot into a more advanced system using Visual Studio Pro.

🧭 Porting to Visual Studio Pro (Planned)
Once development stabilizes on Replit, this project will be:

Fully ported to Visual Studio Pro

Integrated with advanced modules and features

Packaged into an EXE or standalone deployable bot

Possibly upgraded with local LLM or free AI APIs in offline mode

Let me know when you're ready for the next phase — adding the leaderboard, roleplay mode, or full memory system. I can build each as a plug-and-play module! 🍒
